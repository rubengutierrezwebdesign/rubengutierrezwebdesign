        Yesterday I finally got around to adding a side menu for mobile devices to my website.

    <p class="_16">
        Another projects I managed to get started on earlier was putting some code together for a pricing tool I've had in mind for a while now. I'm going to be hosting this little application on my website for anyone to use,  especially for people intrested in get an estimate on developing a website for their business/personal project.
    <p class="_16 mb-20">
        After doing doing some research I was finally able to find the right combination of HTML and JavaScript that does exactly what I need. The code that I Frankensteined takes all the selected values from the inputs in an HTML form and with a little bit of JavaScript it summizes all the selected values and displays a total at the bottom at the click of a button. '<a href="/calculator">Website Pricing Tool</a>'
    </p>
    <h2 class="_20 _500">Future Plans For This Tool I'm Building</h2>
    <p class="_16">
        While it is just a skeleton right now, in the near future I will be adding things like icons and animations to make it as interactive and engaging as possible.
