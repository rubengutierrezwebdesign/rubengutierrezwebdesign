        Like most kids I never really enjoyed reading when I was younger. To me it was just another task that got in the way of me clashing inanimate ojects and making fighting noises.
    </p>

    <p class="_16 mb-20">
        A lot of the time when I was expected to be reading I would just use my pointing finger and scan the pages to give whoever was looking after me the idea that I was paying attentiopn. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="_16 mb-20">
        After a while of pretending to read I think I actually started trying and soon after I found myself just reading to read.

        Eventually my parents got me my own computer and dial-up internet and my obsecsision with knowing a lot about things I was intrested became a positive.

        All this just to say that reading is important and if you want a carear in programming or technology it's a must. A lot of the problems you'll be addressing in the tech industry don't have 2 hours long videos where someone properly describes you're exact situation.

    <p class="_16">
        One of the reasons I really enjoy reading is because it helps lead you're mind on a new path. When you read it's quite easy to get distracted and that one of the main reasons I enjoy doing it so much. down a lot of the voices in your head that can keep you idle.

        Reading has helped me learn so many skills I would have not otherwise had. It's helped me gain new perspectives and allowed me to empathies with people who'm I might have just walked by.

        Whenever you find yourself in a sea of contratdictions just take a deep breathe and try to focus on something you like. Once you have something in mind try and ask some questions about that subject. If you find your.

    <h1>How To Make A Website</h1>

    <p class="_16 mb-25">
        Their are a thousand ways to make a website. 
        
        In this tutorials I'm going to be teaching the simplest way to make a website because I feel like a lot of the tutorials
        online overcomplicate the subject at hand.
        
        If you want to make a website it's fairly simple to build one.
        
        All you have to do is create a new folder and compile.
    </p>

    <div class="cont mb-50">
        <h3 class="_20">Visual Studio Code A Really Good Text Editor</h3>
        <p class="_16">
            In order to start writing code you're going to need a text editor. I suggest installing Visual Studio Code
            because it provides you with a lot of useful tools, but any of them will do.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="cont mb-50">
        <h2>Step 1: Create A Folder</h2>
        <p class="_16">A Website is a program and a program is essentially just files in a folder.</p>
        <p class="_16">The first thing you're going to be doing is open up the folder in your text editor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cont mb-50">
        <h2>Step 2: Creating An HTML File</h2>
        <p class="_16 mb-25">
            The main type of file you'll be using when you're building websites are .HTML files.
        </p>
        <p class="_16">Hyper Text Markup Language is a coding langauge that is used to give structure and render information. </p>

    <p class="_14 mb-20">
        Being a self-taught programmer, the fear of failing was a big part of my story, especially in the early days. I'd constantly be questioning myself, "Am I learning the right thing?" "Am I Googling the right questions?" the thoughts seemed endless.
    </p>

    <h2 class="_20 _400">Don't Let Your Fears Make You Hesitate, Just Keep Trying</h2>
    
    <p class="_14 mb-20"> 
        Lucky for you, I've dug myself out of one of those dark, depressing holes and can confidently tell you things are not as hard as they initially appear. 

        If there's one piece of advice I can give you as someone who's been doing this online stuff for a while it's don't let your fear of failing stop you from doing what you want.
        </p>
    <p class="_14 mb-20">
        It can seem tough right now, especially if you're at the beginning of your journey, but the truth is the more you fail the more you can see analyze the situation to see where you it went wrong. This you get a better understanding of these programs with a ton of moving parts.

    <h2 class="_20 _400 mb-20">
        Programing Is Actually A Lot Easier Than You Think
    </h2>

    <p class="_14 mb-20">
        Programming and code, especially the way it's perceived in popular culture, makes you think, "I could never do that." 
    </p>

    <p class="_14">
        The truth is that not all programming is hard. Don't get me wrong; this definitely is a field of programming that requires a high level of understanding, but for the most part, anyone with a little bit of time on their hands can pick up some pretty basic skills that could substantially improve their lives.
