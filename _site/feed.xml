        Yesterday I finally got around to adding a side menu for mobile screens to my website's navigation menu.

    <h2 class="_20 _400">Getting Started Biulding A Website Pricing Tool</h2>
    <p class="_16">
        Today in the morning, after finishing up my run, I began trying to put some code together for a pricing tool I've had in mind for a while now. This pricing tool that I'm going to be hosting on my website for free will be for anyone looking to get an estimate of how much their website should cost based on some variables.    </p>
    <p class="_16">
        After messing around with some code and doing research, I was finally able to find some HTML and JavaScript that do exactly what I need them to.
    </p>
    <h2 class="_20 _400">Future Plans For This Tool I'm Building</h2>
    <p class="_16">
        While it is just a skeleton right now, in the near future I will be adding things like icons and animations to make it as interactive and engaging as possible.  Feel free to bookmark it so that you can see how it progresses.

        Like most kids I never really enjoyed reading when I was younger. To me it was just another task that got in the way of me clashing inanimate ojects and making fighting noises.

        A lot of the time when I was expected to be reading I would just use my pointing finger and scan the pages to give whoever was looking after me the idea that I was paying attentiopn.

        One of the reasons I really enjoy reading is because it helps lead you're mind on a new path. When you read it's quite easy to get distracted and that one of the main reasons I enjoy doing it so much. down a lot of the voices in your head that can keep you idle.

    <h1>How To Make A Website</h1>

    <p class="_16 mb-25">
        Their are a thousand ways to make a website. 
        
        In this tutorials I'm going to be teaching the simplest way to make a website because I feel like a lot of the tutorials
        online overcomplicate the subject at hand.
        
        If you want to make a website it's fairly simple to build one.
        
        All you have to do is create a new folder and compile.
    </p>

    <div class="cont mb-50">
        <h3 class="_20">Visual Studio Code A Really Good Text Editor</h3>
        <p class="_16">
            In order to start writing code you're going to need a text editor. I suggest installing Visual Studio Code
            because it provides you with a lot of useful tools, but any of them will do.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="cont mb-50">
        <h2>Step 1: Create A Folder</h2>
        <p class="_16">A Website is a program and a program is essentially just files in a folder.</p>
        <p class="_16">The first thing you're going to be doing is open up the folder in your text editor.</p>

    <div class="cont mb-50">
        <h2>Step 2: Creating An HTML File</h2>
        <p class="_16 mb-25">
            The main type of file you'll be using when you're building websites are .HTML files.

    <p class="_14 mb-20">
        Being a self-taught programmer, the fear of failing was a big part of my story, especially in the early days. I'd constantly be questioning myself, "Am I learning the right thing?" "Am I Googling the right questions?" the thoughts seemed endless.
    </p>

    <h2 class="_20 _400">Don't Let Your Fears Make You Hesitate, Just Keep Trying</h2>
    
    <p class="_14 mb-20"> 
        Lucky for you, I've dug myself out of one of those dark, depressing holes and can confidently tell you things are not as hard as they initially appear. 

        If there's one piece of advice I can give you as someone who's been doing this online stuff for a while it's don't let your fear of failing stop you from doing what you want.
        </p>
    <p class="_14 mb-20">
        It can seem tough right now, especially if you're at the beginning of your journey, but the truth is the more you fail the more you can see analyze the situation to see where you it went wrong. This you get a better understanding of these programs with a ton of moving parts.

        Programing Is Actually A Lot Easier Than You Think
    </h2>

    <p class="_14 mb-20">
        Programming and code, especially the way it's perceived in popular culture, makes you think, "I could never do that." 
    </p>

    <p class="_14">
        The truth is that not all programming is hard. Don't get me wrong; this definitely is a field of programming that requires a high level of understanding, but for the most part, anyone with a little bit of time on their hands can pick up some pretty basic skills that could substantially improve their lives.

        What is this?
This is a mobile website design for a car importing/importer business. Kei cars are the smallest category of vehicles sold in Japan. The word 'Kei' translates to 'Light Automobile' in Japanese.

Kei cars specifically Kei trucks are small work utility vehicles that are becoming sought after in the United States especially among the rural population.

Some of the reasons Kei Trucks are becoming more popular in America is because of their practicality, their fuel efficiency, & their low cost of maintenance. 

I've noticed a lot of people buying these and figured that using a Kei Truck would be fitting for this type of business and design.

To make this I took inspiration from automotive website designs I found online along with some personal knowledge about the type of information you want to see when your shopping for cars online and this is what I came up with.

I spend a few hours designing the layout and spend another hour or two making the logo look as cool as possible.  I used 'League gothic' for the big 'IMPORTER' text on top and translated 'car imported' to Japanese text and placed it right underneath.

For about 5,000 American Buckaroos you can get yourself a decent low mileage 550cc 3 cylinder gas sipper to help you easily maneuver around your lot.

Tell me what you think below, I enjoy hearing feedback from other!

    <p class="_16">
        This is a landing page I made in Figma. It offers a website starter package in the Brea, California area.  I designed this webpage/service for beginners who are interested in starting a website.  It contains a lot of basic essential and design services to get up and running in no time.

        Often times the concepts and vocabulary around website development can put off people who simply just want a website but don't want to learn the technology.

        My goal for this landing page was to help make website design services look more like a product you can order or buy on a shelf.
