    <h2 class="_24">Don't Let Your Fears Paralyze You</h2>

    <p class="_16 mb-25">
        One of the challenges I faced when I first started taking an intrest in programing and the web was the fear of failure.
    </p>

    <p class="_16 mb-25">
        The fear of failing and messing things ups can keep you from doing what you want to do in life. Even worse if you let those thoughts linger for too long you'll become paralyzed and you can suddenly feel like your in the passenger seat of your own life.
    </p>

    <p class="class _16 mb-25">
        Lucky for you I've dug myself out of one of those dark depressing holes and can gladly tell you things are not as hard as you percieve them.
    </p>

    <h2>Programing Can Be A Lot Easier Than You Think</h2>

    <p class="_16">
        Programming and code especially the way it's percieved in popular media gives a lot of people the idea that you need to be some high strung math geniuous to do it and that simply couldn't be further from the truth.
    </p>

    <p class="_16">
        The truth is that not all programming requires a high level of understanding. Once you establish yourself with the basics you can chip away at moutains of information to become a full fledge technology proffessional.
