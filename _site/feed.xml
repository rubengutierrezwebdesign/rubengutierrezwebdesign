    <h2 class="_24">Don't Let Your Fears Paralyze You</h2>

    <p class="_16 mb-25">
        One of the challenges I faced when I first started taking an intrest in programing and the web was the fear of failure.
    </p>

    <p class="_16 mb-25">
        The fear of failing and messing things ups can keep you from doing what you want to do in life. Even worse if you let those thoughts linger for too long you'll become paralyzed and you can suddenly feel like your in the passenger seat of your own life.
    </p>

    <p class="class _16 mb-25">
        Lucky for you I've dug myself out of one of those dark depressing holes and can gladly tell you things are not as hard as you percieve them.
    </p>

    <h2>Programing Can Be A Lot Easier Than You Think</h2>

    <p class="_16">
        Programming and code especially the way it's percieved in popular media gives a lot of people the idea that you need to be some high strung math geniuous to do it and that simply couldn't be further from the truth.
    </p>

    <p class="_16">
        The truth is that programming can be just as easy as it can be complicated. What I mean by that is that while yes you do need to know a lot to build more complicated pieces of software you can also do some pretty amazing things with the fundamentals.

        Like most kids I never really enjoyed reading when I was younger. It was just one of those things that older people kept telling me was good so I would just scan the book with my finger until they would get distracted and I could go back to play fighting with inanimate objects. Ironically enough, I'd get so bored pretending to read at some point I began to try and make sense of the letters and words infront of me.
    </p>

    <p class="_16 mb-50">
        Soon enough I was just reading to read. At the doctors office, read. 
        Awkard situations, read. Forced to wait for hours at a bus stop, read.
        Eventually my parents got me my own computer and dial-up internet and my obsecsision with knowing a lot about things I was intrested became a positive.

        Now a days we take our ability to consume productive and useful content whenever we want for granite and how could you not. 
    </p>

    <p class="_16 mb-50">
        All this just to say that reading is important and if you want a carear in programming or technology it's a must. A lot of the problems you'll be addressing in the tech industry don't have 2 hours long videos where someone properly describes you're exact situation. 
    </p>



    <h2 class="_22">Does Anyone Even Read Anymore</h2>
    <p class="_16">One of the reasons I really enjoy reading is because it helps quite down a lot of the voices in your head that can keep you idle.</p>

    <p class="_16">Reading has helped me learn so many skills I would have not otherwise had. It's helped me gain new perspectives and allowed me to empathies with people who'm I might have just walked by.

    <p>This is the Nike category section of an online shoe shop I designed in Figma.</p>

    <h2>Why I Made This Online Shoe Website Design</h2>

    <p>I've had a fascination with Nike shoes my whole life. Nikes especially Jordans are one of my favorite shoes and probably some of the most recognizable of all times.</p>

    <p>"Do they look great?" Yes! "Do they look good on me?" No, my ankles are too big!</p>

    <p>Despite that I am fascinated by the the unique shapes and color combination. I enjoy these types of so much that I decided to design this online shoe shop that sells modern releases of these awesome retro sneakers.
    </p>

    <p>One of my favorite features on this design is the color pallet in the top left corner of every shoe option.  The pallet contains the main colors on each shoe. My goal with this pallet is to help the buyer pick out shoes to match based on outfits they already have. 
    </p>

    <p>An improvement I'd like to add in the future is to lengthen the color pallet bar and break it up based on the percentage of each color on the shoe. If the shoe has a black base then half the bar would be black and if the shoe has small amounts of colors or highlights then only about a fifth of the bar would be colored in.
    </p>

    <p>

            This is a WordPress pricing table design that I made to advertise WordPress website services. My aim with this design was to help ordinary people who don't know a whole lot websites visualize these types of services as a more off the shelf product rather than some complicated topic.

        <p class="_16">
            What I've noticed is that their's a ton of people out there who want to start a website but the moment they go look into one they're bombarded with a ton of offers filled with jargon keywords that just don't make a whole lot of sense to them. This usually causes them to just keep day dreaming about the idea and eventually they push it to the back of their mind.
