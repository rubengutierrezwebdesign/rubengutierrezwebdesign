        Yesterday I finally got around to adding a side menu for mobile screens to my website's navigation menu.

        After testing it and figuring out the bugs, it's up and functional; how it looks is a work in progress.

    <h2 class="_20 _400">Getting Started Biulding A Website Pricing Tool</h2>
    <p class="_16">
        Today in the morning, after finishing up my run, I began trying to put some code together for a pricing tool I've had in mind for a while now. This pricing tool that I'm going to be hosting on my website for free will be for anyone looking to get an estimate of how much their website should cost based on some variables.    </p>
    <p class="_16">
        After messing around with some code and doing research, I was finally able to find some HTML and JavaScript that do exactly what I need them to.
    </p>
    <h2 class="_20 _400">Future Plans For This Tool I'm Building</h2>
    <p class="_16">
        While it is just a skeleton right now, in the near future I will be adding things like icons and animations to make it as interactive and engaging as possible.  Feel free to bookmark it so that you can see how it progresses.
