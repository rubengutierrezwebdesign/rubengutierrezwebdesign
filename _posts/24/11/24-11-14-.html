        Yesterday I finally added a side menu along with a hamburger icon to my website's navigation area. It's completely functional; how the side menu looks right now is a work in progress.

        After finishing up my run this morning, I got home, drank my coffee, and figured out the HTML/Javascript for a tool that I'm currently working on. The tool I'm going to be hosting on my website is a calculator that will give you an estimate of how much a website should cost based on common options. Check it out the website design calculator I made.

        Like many things in my life it's work in progress I'm planning on adding some cool icons and animaton with the goal of trying to make it as interactive as I can.
