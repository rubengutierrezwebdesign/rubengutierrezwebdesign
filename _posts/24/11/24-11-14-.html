        Yesterday I finally got around to adding a side menu for mobile devices to my website.

        After testing it and working out the bugs, it's up and functional; how it looks is a work in progress.

    <h2 class="_20 _500">Biulding A Website Pricing Tool</h2>
    <p class="_16">
        Earlier today I began trying to put some code together for a pricing tool I've had in mind for a while now. This pricing tool that I'm going to be hosting on my website for free will be for anyone to use. I especially want people that are looking to get an estimate on a website project to use it.

        After doing my research I was finally able to find the right combination of HTML and JavaScript that does exactly what I need it to do. The code that I frankensteined takes all the selected values from the inputs and adds them up onces youo click the submit button. Check it out '<a href="/calculator">Website Pricing Tool</a>'

    <h2 class="_20 _500">Future Plans For This Tool I'm Building</h2>
    <p class="_16">
        While it is just a skeleton right now, in the near future I will be adding things like icons and animations to make it as interactive and engaging as possible.
