        Being a self-taught programmer, the fear of failing was a big part of my story, especially in the early days. I'd constantly be questioning myself, "Am I learning the right thing?" "Am I Googling the right questions?" the thoughts seemed endless.

        Lucky for you, I've dug myself out of one of those dark, depressing holes and can confidently tell you things are not as hard as they initially appear. 

        If there's one piece of advice I can give you as someone who's been doing this online stuff for a while it's don't let your fear of failing stop you from doing what you want.

        It can seem tough right now, especially if you're at the beginning of your journey, but the truth is the more you fail the more you can see analyze the situation to see where you it went wrong. This you get a better understanding of these programs with a ton of moving parts.

        Programing Is Actually A Lot Easier Than You Think

        The truth is that not all programming is hard. Don't get me wrong; this definitely is a field of programming that requires a high level of understanding, but for the most part, anyone with a little bit of time on their hands can pick up some pretty basic skills that could substantially improve their lives.
