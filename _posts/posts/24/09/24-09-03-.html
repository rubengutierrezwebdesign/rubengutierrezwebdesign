<div class="in-cont">
    <p>Today I decided that I'm going to be working on improving the about me page on my site.
    </p>

    <h2>Changing to Resume Style Rather Than A Portfolio Look</h2>

    <p>I'm going to be trying to make it look more like a resume than a portfolio, kind of of the same thing but not really.
    </p>

    <h2>How It's Changing
    </h2>

    <p>I'm going to really focus on being descriptive about my skill level and what it is exactly I know how to do.</p>
</div>
