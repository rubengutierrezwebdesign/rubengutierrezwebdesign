        The fear of failing and messing things ups can keep you from doing what you want to do in life. Even worse if you let those thoughts linger for too long you'll become paralyzed and you can suddenly feel like your in the passenger seat of your own life.

    <h2>Programing Can Be A Lot Easier Than You Think</h2>

    <p class="_16">
        Programming and code especially the way it's percieved in popular media gives a lot of people the idea that you need to be some high strung math geniuous to do it and that simply couldn't be further from the truth.

    <p class="_16">
        The truth is that programming can be just as easy as it can be complicated. What I mean by that is that while yes you do need to know a lot to build more complicated pieces of software you can also do some pretty amazing things with the fundamentals.
