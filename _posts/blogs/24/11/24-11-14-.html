        Yesterday I finally got around to adding a side menu for mobile devices to my website.

        After testing it and working out the bugs, it's up and functional; how it looks is a work in progress.

        Another projects I managed to get started on earlier was putting some code together for a pricing tool I've had in mind for a while now. I'm going to be hosting this little application on my website for anyone to use,  especially for people intrested in get an estimate on developing a website for their business/personal project.

        After doing doing some research I was finally able to find the right combination of HTML and JavaScript that does exactly what I need. The code that I Frankensteined takes all the selected values from the inputs in an HTML form and with a little bit of JavaScript it summizes all the selected values and displays a total at the bottom at the click of a button.

        While it is just a skeleton right now, in the near future I will be adding things like icons and animations to make it as interactive and engaging as possible.
